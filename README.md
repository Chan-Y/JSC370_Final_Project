# Criminal Statistics in Toronto

## About the Project

This was completed as a final project for the course "JSC370: Data Science II" at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Motivation & Description 

Toronto has been the city with the highest crime rate in Canada, with concerns raised about the frequency of severe types of crime and their occurrence in different neighborhoods. In addition, other important socio-economic indicators such as inflation and unemployment rates play a significant role in understanding the overall well-being of a city. 


This project aims to provide an overview of the crime situation in Toronto from 2014 to 2021, including the frequency of severe types of crime in different neighborhoods, and examine any potential correlation between crime rates and changes in inflation and unemployment rates.
